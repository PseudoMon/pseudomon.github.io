    <h2>Aliya N. Anindita</h2>
	
    <p>Hello! I'm Aliya, a twenty-three-year-old from Jakarta, Indonesia. I'm a fiction <span class="accent">writer</span>, a web <span class="accent">developer</span>, a <span class="accent">translator</span>, and a student of <span class="accent">International Relations</span>. This is my homepage, where I store some of my finished work.</p> 

	<p>On the internet, I'm also known as <span class="accent">PseudoMon</span> and <span class="accent">Telescopic</span>.</p>

	<p>I speak English and Indonesian, and am currently studying Japanese and French.</p> 

	<p>Other than the above four occupations, I read a lot of <span class="accent">science fiction and fantasy novels</span>. I also play a ton of <span class="accent">video games</span>, with particular interest in indie games, narrative adventures, and RPGs.</p> 

	<p>You can contact me through my <a href="https://pseudomon.wordpress.com">blog</a>, where I discuss the things I like, or my <a href="https://twitter.com/PseudoMonious">Twitter</a>, where I yell about the things I like. You can also e-mail me with my <a href="contact.html">contact form</a>.
	
	<p>Cheers!</p>
