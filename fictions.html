    <h2>Aliya N. Anindita</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Aliya, a twenty-year-old from Jakarta, Indonesia.
      I'm currently studying <span class="accent">International Relations</span> at school.
      In my spare time I write <span class="accent">stories</span>,
      code <span class="accent">programs</span>
      and try <span class="accent">new things</span>.
      This is my homepage where I stash them!
    </p>
    <p>I'm also known as <span class="accent">PseudoMon</span>, <span class="accent">PseudoStygian</span>, and <span class="accent">Telescopic</span>.</p>
    <p>I speak English and Indonesian, can understand Malay, French, and Sundanese, and am currently learning Japanese</p>
    <p>I read a lot, with interest in history both fictional and real, science fiction and fantasy, and weird prose.</p>
    <p>I play a lot of games, with particular interest to indie games in general, narrative adventure games, and RPG from either side of the globe.</p>
    <p>You can contact me through my <a href="https://pseudomon.wordpress.com">blog</a>, my <a href="https://twitter.com/PseudoStygian">Twitter</a>, or e-mail me with my <a href="contact.html">contact form</a>.
