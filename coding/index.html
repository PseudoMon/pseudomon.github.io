  <h1>I do game programming, frontend web development, and UX engineering</h1>
<p>I started building websites when I was nine years old and have not stopped since. My main interest is in creating websites that are accessible, both from usability and development point of view, and can convey all the needed information while also having its own personality.</p>
<p>I’m also a game programmer with particular interest in designing and implementing user interface. I have experience working with Unity, Unreal 5, and a few more niche engines.</p>
<p>I’m currently open for work! Hire me to create your unique website, or to handle all the UI needs for your game!</p>

    <section class="description">
      <p>I built this static website from the grounds up! The design was sketched out in Figma, and then coded using basic HTML (+ Nunjucks templating) and vanilla CSS (with PostCSS for back-compatibility and organization). Content is written in markdown files. They’re all then combined with Eleventy.</p>
<p>I reconstruct this site every few years or so. The current design has three main colours, referring to my three skillsets, and partially inspired by retrofuturism aesthetic.</p>

      <p><img src="/images/porto_tlvr.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the site"></p>
<p>TLVR (short for Tetralingual Voice Record) is a website where people can browse text and audio files from the game Arknights, in a way where they can easily switch between languages that the game is available in. I built it explicitly to help language-learners and to easily compare between different voice acting.</p>
<p>The design was created in Figma with a responsive mobile-first approach before then adjusted for desktop. The website was built using SvelteKit with intention of being full-stack, although it’s then adapted to a static site for easier access and deployment.</p>
<p>Data for the site’s content was gathered from other community-created databases, collected using Python scripts, and processed into JSON for the site.</p>

<p>Multilingual Genshin Database hosts text data from the video game Genshin Impact, in all the languages it’s available in. It’s built from the grounds-up to make comparison between languages easier, which is hopefully helpful for language-learners, those interested in video game localizations, or just fans of the games.</p>
<p>It was built with Remix. The data was taken from a public repository and then further processed with custom Python scripting.</p>
<p>This database is a sister site to Pradewata, my personal project to retranslate Genshin Impact into Indonesian in a way that retains each character’s personality. The website was built with the same stack.</p>

    <section class="description">
      <p><img src="/images/porto_miniblaseball.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the site"></p>
<p>#MiniBlaseball is a website I was commissioned to build by <a href="https://twitter.com/HetreaSky">HetreaSky</a> to display his collection of “mini” art, each one depicting a player or other entity in the (now defunct) live-service absurdist horror sports game, Blaseball.</p>
<p>The website itself is a single-page app (SPA) which reads data from JSON files. It features sorting and filtering by various factors, multiple “pages”, light and dark themes, responsive design, lazy-loading of images, and display of either randomized or specific art, depending on the filter.</p>
<p>It was first built in Riot, a niche UI library, before being rewritten in Svelte. Data was written into each image’s file name and additionally in an Eno file, which was parsed with Python into JSON for use by the web app.</p>

<p>Lightning Cards is a flash card web app built with Riot, a niche UI library similar to Vue. The web app works as an SPA that automatically saves data in the browser using the Local Storage API, but also allows importing/exporting this data through JSON.</p>
<p>I built Lightning Cards because I wanted a flash card app that is simple to use, where I can easily and quickly create new cards and then practice with them like I would physical paper cards. I found existing apps like Anki is too complicated for my needs.</p>

<p>Landscape Game 2 is an educational multiplayer strategy game commissioned by the Center for International Forestry Research and created by a team of ~10 at Agate. I was asked on board to help redefine the UX of the game.</p>
<p>I worked with designers and a UI artist to create a user interface that is legible on mobile while still containing the density of data typically necessary in a fast-paced strategy game. I was then also responsible for translating the design into the engine.</p>

<p>Elven Dungeon is a game made by Agate RnD team. It was made as an internal project in four months and not publicly available.</p>
<p>I was one of four programmers on the game. Most of my contributions are on the user interface: I transformed the design from Figma into in-game UI and ensured it runs smoothly whether controlled by mouse+keyboard or a controller. I also helped with various mechanics of the game, such as the weather system and the dungeon-generation system.</p>
