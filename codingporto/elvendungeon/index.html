<p>Elven Dungeon is a game made by Agate RnD team. It was made as an internal project in four months and not publicly available.</p>
<p>I was one of four programmers on the game. Most of my contributions are on the user interface: I transformed the design from Figma into in-game UI and ensured it runs smoothly whether controlled by mouse+keyboard or a controller. I also helped with various mechanics of the game, such as the weather system and the dungeon-generation system.</p>
