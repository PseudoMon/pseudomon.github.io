<p>Multilingual Genshin Database hosts text data from the video game Genshin Impact, in all the languages it’s available in. It’s built from the grounds-up to make comparison between languages easier, which is hopefully helpful for language-learners, those interested in video game localizations, or just fans of the games.</p>
<p>It was built with Remix. The data was taken from a public repository and then further processed with custom Python scripting.</p>
<p>This database is a sister site to Pradewata, my personal project to retranslate Genshin Impact into Indonesian in a way that retains each character’s personality. The website was built with the same stack.</p>
