<h4>Project Description</h4>
<p>Landscape Game 2 is an educational multiplayer strategy game commissioned by the Center for International Forestry Research and created by a team of ~10 at Agate. I was asked on board to help redefine the UX of the game. I worked with designers and a UI artist to create a user interface that is legible on mobile while still containing the density of data typically necessary in a fast-paced strategy game.</p>
