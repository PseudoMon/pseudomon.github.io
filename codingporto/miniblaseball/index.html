<p>#MiniBlaseball is a website I was commissioned to build by <a href="https://twitter.com/HetreaSky">HetreaSky</a> to display his collection of “mini” art, each one depicting a player or other entity in the (now defunct) live-service absurdist horror sports game, Blaseball.</p>
<p>The website itself is a single-page app (SPA) which reads data from JSON files. It features sorting and filtering by various factors, multiple “pages”, light and dark themes, responsive design, lazy-loading of images, and display of either randomized or specific art, depending on the filter.</p>
<p>It was first built in Riot, a niche UI library, before being rewritten in Svelte. Data was written into each image’s file name and additionally in an Eno file, which was parsed with Python into JSON for use by the web app.</p>
