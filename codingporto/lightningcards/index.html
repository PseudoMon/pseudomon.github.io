<p>Lightning Cards is a flash card web app built with Riot, a niche UI library similar to Vue. The web app works as an SPA that automatically saves data in the browser using the Local Storage API, but also allows importing/exporting this data through JSON.</p>
<p>I built Lightning Cards because I wanted a flash card app that is simple to use, where I can easily and quickly create new cards and then practice with them like I would physical paper cards. I found existing apps like Anki is too complicated for my needs.</p>
