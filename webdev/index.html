     <h1>CSS wizard, HTML wrangler, and JavaScript tamer</h1>
<p>I started building websites when I was nine years old and have not stopped since. I believe that websites can be built to have unique personalities, to be a joy to behold, but most of all to be an <em>accessible</em> way to show information on the web. Bloat is my nemesis.</p>
<p>My skill lies mostly in frontend web development. I have mastery of modern CSS and HTML and a good grasp of JavaScript. My framework of choice is <a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a>, but I've also worked with <a href="https://reactjs.org">React</a> and <a href="https://vuejs.org">Vue</a>. Outside of the frontend, I have experience with Python, Ruby, and C#, which I've used for automation, data visualization, web backend, and game development.</p>
<p>I'm currently gainfully employed and not looking for work!</p>
<p>Below are some of my personal projects!</p>
<section>
<h1>Multilingual Genshin Database</h1>
<p><a href="https://multilingual-genshin.netlify.app/">Multilingual Genshin Database</a> hosts text data from the video game Genshin Impact, in all the languages it's available in. It's built from the grounds-up to make comparison between languages easier, which is hopefully helpful for language-learners, those interested in video game localizations, or just fans of the games.</p>
<p>It was built with <a href="https://remix.run/">Remix</a>. The data was taken from a public repository and then further processed with custom Python scripting.</p>

<h1>Pradewata</h1>
<p><a href="https://pradewata.netlify.app/">Pradewata</a> is a personal project to retranslate a portion of Genshin Impact into Indonesian, aiming for a translation that better reflects the characters' personality. It is a sister site to Multilingual Genshin Database and utilizes the same technology.</p>

<section>
<h1>This website!</h1>
<p>This website was built using <a href="11ty.dev">Eleventy</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. The design was first visualized on <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a> before I then code it by hand into vanilla HTML/CSS sprinkled with <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a> markup. Icons is provided by <a href="https://icomoon.io">IcoMoon</a>.</p>
<p>A previous version of this website was made using my own static site generator, <a href="https://github.com/PseudoMon/plater">Plater</a>, which I built with Python. That project is no longer maintained.</p>

<section>
<h1>MiniBlaseball</h1>
<p><a href="https://miniblaseball.surge.sh">MiniBlaseball</a> is a website I built for <a href="https://twitter.com/HetreaSky">@HetreaSky</a> to display his series of art depicting the many players in Internet League Blaseball. It was built with <a href="https://svelte.dev">Svelte</a> and contain these features, among other: filtering and sorting, quick searching, lazy-loading of images, instanteous change between light and dark themes, responsive design, and adaptive display area.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h1>Big Black</h1>
<p><a href="https://pseudomon.github.io/big-black/">Big Black</a> is a responsive blog theme made with large font size and brutalist concept in mind. It was built by hand with modern CSS and HTML with no external framework or library.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h1>Lightning Cards</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/PseudoMon/lightningcards">Lightning Cards</a> is a simple flash card web app that can help you memorize thing. It runs entirely on the front end and built with <a href="https://riot.js.org">Riot</a>. I still use to help me practice foreign languages, although I've been thinking up rebuilding and upgrading it for a while.</p>

<section>
<h1>No-Nonsense Basic JavaScript Guide for the Novice Web Developer</h1>
<p>This guide with the overly long title is exactly <a href="https://nononsensebasicjs.readthedocs.io/">what it says it is</a>. It's the kind of guide I hope I had when I was starting out.</p>
